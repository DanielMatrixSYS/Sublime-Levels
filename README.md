Contribution & Usage:

This project was singularly crafted by me, from inception to its current form. Here's how you can interact with it:

    Usage: Feel free to utilize the code as per your needs. Modify, adapt, but always give credit. Republishing the addon as-is, however, is prohibited.

    Contribution: Keen on improving Sublime Levels? Open a pull request! But remember:
        Maintain code consistency.
        Propose small, incremental changes rather than a massive overhaul.
        Large pull requests with extensive changes will not be entertained.

Your inputs are valued. Although I may not be frequently available to incorporate feature requests, I'm always on the lookout for bug fixes.
Note:

The addon was once retailing on gmodstore. However, balancing a job, personal life, academic commitments, and gmodstore was overwhelming. Thus, I've decided to offer it for free to the community.

For queries, feel free to reach out. However, please be mindful of the fact that due to my busy schedule, feature requests might not always get immediate attention. Bug reports, on the other hand, are always welcome.
