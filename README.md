# Sublime levels
## A garry's mod leveling system.

Sublime levels offers a variety of nice things a leveling system needs, such as, but is not limited to, levels, experience, skill tree/perks, leaderboards and in-game admin configuration.

Sublime levels, in its whole entierty was created by me, and solely me. You may use the code as you see fit, make changes and redistribute as long as credit is given, however, the addon can not be republished. The addon is no longer for sale on gmodstore, as I can not manage my job, free time, studies and gmodstore at the same time, it was way too much work, so I have released it for free.

You are also free to make changes, then open up a pull request to have it added into the actual addon. Please keep the code standard the same, and only pull request small changes at the same time. Do not open up a pull request after you've made thousands of changes, it will be denied.

You're welcome to contact me, however feature requests and implementation will most likely be ignored unless you've caught me at a good time. Bug fixes however, I can do.

Database supported are SQLite and MySQL.
