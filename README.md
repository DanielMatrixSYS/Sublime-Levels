## Contribution & Use Guidelines

I solely created Sublime Levels. While you're encouraged to utilize and modify the code, kindly adhere to the following:

- **Usage:** You're free to adapt and change the code, but ensure you give proper credit. Direct republishing of the addon is not permitted.
  
- **Contributions:** Want to enhance Sublime Levels? Submit a pull request! But keep in mind:
  - Stick to the existing code standards.
  - Make small, incremental changes. Large, comprehensive PRs are discouraged and may not be approved.

I value your feedback. While I may not always be available for feature additions, I'm always open to addressing and rectifying bugs.

## Installation

Drag and drop the folder within the ZIP file into your garrysmod/addons folder. Restart the server.

## A Quick Note

The addon was once available for purchase on gmodstore. Balancing multiple commitments led to the decision of making it free for the community. While I might not always be available for feature implementations, bug fixes are always on my radar.

For any inquiries or reports, feel free to get in touch. Just be aware, due to my busy schedule, not all feature requests may receive immediate attention.
